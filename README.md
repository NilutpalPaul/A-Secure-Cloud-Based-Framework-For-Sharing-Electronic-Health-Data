# A-Secure-Cloud-Based-Framework-For-Sharing-Electronic-Health-Data


In this Proposed system, there are Four modules in this project. They are:
1.	Data Owner
2.	Data User
3.	Certificate Authority 
4.	Cloud server
Data Owners
In this module, the data provider uploads their encrypted patient data in the Cloud server. For the security purpose the user encrypts the data file and then store in the server. The User can have capable of manipulating the encrypted data file and performs the following operations Upload Patient Report , Update Patient Report ,Delete Patient Report ,View All Patient Reports.
Cloud Server
The Cloud server manages which is to provide data storage service for the Data Owners. Data owners encrypt their data files and store them in the Server for sharing with data consumers and performs the following operations such as View End Users ,View Data Providers ,View Patient Reports ,Patient Report Attackers ,View All Patient Report Transactions,View Results ,View Decrypt Permission ,View Private Key Permission. 
Data  User 
In this module, the user can only access the data file with the secret key. The user can search the file for a specified keyword and end user and can do the following operations like Search Patient Reports, View Patient Reports ,Download Patient Reports ,Request Key ,View Key Response ,Req Decrypt Permission, Decrypt Permission Response.

Certificate Authority
In this module, the key CA performs the following operations View Transactions, View File Private Keys ,Private Key Permission ,Give Decrypt Permission ,Files With Decrypt Permission ,Files Without Decrypt Permission





BEHAVIORAL CONCEPT
In software engineering, behavioral model describe the overall behavior of the system. There are two types of behavioral models that are used to describe the system behavior, one is data processing model and another is state machine models. Data processing models are also known as DFD (Data Flow Diagram) which is used to show how data is processed as it moves through the system. State machine model is also known as State diagram which is used to show how the system will react with external events.
